## Version Control

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) <img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.png" width="100">
  - coding projects
  - long documents



* [Github](https://github.com/) <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" width="100">
  - online copy
  - collaboration

As a fundamental tool for coding, there are plenty of excellent tutorials online.

* Youtube videos
  * 10-min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4CQBuZ4IGo) in Chinese.
  * 1-hour [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) for beginners.

## Interfaces

* Command line interface (CLI)
* Graphic user interface
  - [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

---

## Linux

* GUI for PC
* Command line for cloud compting
  * E.g: [CUHK SCRP](https://scrp-login.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/)

## Basic Linux

* `mkdir`: make directory
* `cd`: change directory
* `ls`: display files
* `cp`: copy a file
* `nano`: open a file in a text editor called "nano"
* `uname`: name of the system


---

## Basic Commands

### Local

* `git config --global user.name <name>`
* `git config --global user.email <email>`

* .gitignore
* `git help <command>` gets help for a git command
* `git init`  creates a new git repo, with data stored in the `.git` directory
* `git status` inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area.
* `git add filename` adds files to the staging area from working directory.
* `git add filename1 filename2` adds multiple files to the staging area.

---

### Commit

* `git commit` stores changes from the staging area to the repository.
* `git commit -m "Commit Message"` The commit message must be in the quotation marks.
* `git log` displays historical commits stored chronologically in the repository.
* `git tag -a v1.0 -m 'message' [optional:commit-id]`


---

### Eraser-like features

The latest commit is called **HEAD** commit

* `git show HEAD`  displays view the HEAD commit.
* `git checkout HEAD filename` restores the file in the working directory to what you made in last commit.
* `git reset HEAD filename` unstages the file from committing in the staging area. It does not discard file changes from the working directory; it just removes them from the staging area.
* `git reset SHA` works by using **the first 7 characters** of the SHA of a previous commit.


---

### Branch

Branches can be created for new project features.

The ultimate goal is to merge that feature into the master branch.

* `git branch` displays the current branch.
* `git branch brach_name` creates a new branch
* `git checkout branch_name` switches to a branch
* `git merge branch_name` merges the branch


---

## GitHub

* Cloud git services:
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * [gitee (China)](https://gitee.com/) ...

::: {.fragment}
* GitHub most popular
  * Free Pro account for students

---

## Remote

* `git clone https://github.com/user_name/repo_name`
* `git remote add origin` adds the origin remote's URL.
* `git remote -v` lists git project's remote copies.
* `git push origin master` uploads local commits to the remote repository.
* `git pull` downloads the remote copy and merge.
* `git fetch` fetches the remote copy to the local hard disk.


---

## Collaboration

Collaboration typically works as the following:

1. Fetch, pull, and merge changes from a remote repository;
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature;
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work;
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case other collaborators have uploaded new commits while you were working);
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review.


---

### Conflict

* Collaborators working separately on the same line of a file may easily encounter conflicts.
* If so, `git pull` will not merge changes from the remote into local repo.
* Need to resolve the conflicts


---

## Markdown

* Text only.
* Simple syntax.
* [Cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)


---

## IDE


* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Visual_Studio_Code_1.18_icon.svg/1200px-Visual_Studio_Code_1.18_icon.svg.png" width="100">
